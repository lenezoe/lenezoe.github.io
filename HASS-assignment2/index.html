				<h2>Example 1 - Dengue Trends in 2020</h2>
				<p>This visualisation was published by the National Environment Agency (NEA) in Singapore on 3 June
					2020, as
					part of a press release to warn Singapore about the spike in dengue cases even as the COVID-19
					pandemic was raging, and to urge collective efforts to prevent dengue.
					Broadly, the chart was intended to complement NEA's message that the trend of dengue cases from
					January to
					April 2020 was abnormally high in Singapore's history.

					<h4>Data (What they are showing)</h4>
					<h3>Chart more suitable for data exploration than communicating multiple messages</h3>
					<p>The visualisation creator was trying to convey NEA's messages that in 2020, the annual trend of
						<strong>(a) weekly</strong> and <strong>(b) total dengue</strong>
						cases was abnormally higher than trend of dengue cases in specific years by plotting
						quantitative
						data - number of dengue cases every week - over 52 weeks in a year, from 2013 to 2020.
					</p>
					<p>The chart shows only the
						<strong>weekly</strong> number of dengue cases.
						However, NEA's press release described the weekly trends in terms of
						"past X months" rather than "weeks". This means the reader has to mentally calculate which month each
						week in the chart belongs to, while referring to the text. 
						The creator could have <strong>aggregated</strong> the weekly number of dengue cases by
						<strong>month</strong> to reduce this cognitive effort.

					</p>
					<p>Showing many years in the chart also makes it difficult for the viewer to understand which are the focal data in NEA's message. </p>
					<p>
						Not showing the <strong>total</strong> number of dengue cases from 2013 to 2019 and
						<strong>projected</strong> total dengue cases in 2020 makes it harder for the reader to believe
						that the trend of high dengue cases from April to May 2020 would continue, given that it
						<strong>coincided with the 2020 Circuit Breaker period</strong>, where more people stayed at
						home and were exposed to mosquitoes in their neighbourhood.

					<h4>Idiom (How they are showing it)</h4>
					<h3>Chart junk</h3>
					<p>There are <strong>too many colours</strong> used, and it is not intuitive what colour is related
						to which year.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reader has to exert extra cognitive effort to link each year and colour on the legend, to
						the colour of the line on the chart, before they can see the trend of the target year.</p>
					<p>In addition, showing <strong>too many line markers</strong> (52 lines for 52 weeks) clutters the
						chart and is redundant. It would be easier to read if the line markers were divided into months
						instead.</p>

				<h4>Suggestions to Improve</h4>
				<h3>1. 2 Charts to Show Expected Trend</h3>

				<p>Since this chart is intended for communication to the public, and not data exploratory analysis
					by NEA, perhaps the creator
					could have split this chart into 2 line charts with different data to convey different
					meanings. Specifically, NEA mentioned in its press release that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><em>
								"Singapore has not seen such a high weekly number of dengue cases since the peak years
								in 2013 and 2014"</em></p>
					</li>
					<p>Suggestion: Using a line chart, instead of showing every year of data, the creator could have
						focused on the <strong>average
							number</strong> of <strong>weekly</strong> dengue cases from 2013 to 2019 (black line), and
						compared this
						trend with 2020's historical number of weekly dengue cases (red line). This chart would have
						communicated more clearly that 2020 has an abnormal trend of dengue cases compared to previous
						years.</p>
					<p>
						The weekly case data can be aggregated into monthly data to be better aligned with NEA's
						messages and avoid confusing the user.
					</p>
					<p>
						If projected data is available, NEA could possibly illustrate that the trend of dengue cases
						from January to June 2020 was expected to continue in the rest of 2020 if action was not taken.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>A chart illustrating this has been produced on the left.</em>
					</p>

					<p></p>
					<li>
						<p><em>"The number of dengue cases this year is expected to exceed the 15,998 cases reported in
								2019, and
								may even surpass the 22,170 cases reported in 2013"</em></p>
						<p>
							Suggestion: Using a column chart, the creator could have focused on the <strong>total
								historical number</strong>
							of dengue cases from <strong>2013 to 2020</strong> (1 bar per year), and show the
							<strong>historical</strong>
							(solid line) and <strong>projected</strong> (stacked on top of the 2020 solid bar) total
							number of
							cases in 2020.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Suggestions to Improve</h4>
				<h3>2. Polar Plot to Show Abnormal Weekly Trends</h3>
				<p>Instead of a line chart, NEA could also choose to use a polar plot to show the weekly trends in
					dengue across months and years more clearly.
					The creator could bold the line for 2020 to make it more salient to the user. An example of a polar
					plot showing data with monthly seasonality across years is shown on the right.

				<h3>Misleading linking of 2 datasets</h3>
				<p>It was misleading for the creator to directly link the concept of fertility rate with current
					population size, if the
					intent was to show population growth or decline.</p>

				<p><strong>First</strong>, a country's population growth or decline is not attributed only to fertility
					rate, but also
					the concepts of mortality rate (which is further dependent on life expectancy), immigration and
					emigration.</p>

				<p><strong>Second</strong>, fertility rate is not based on the actual number of live births in a given
					year (which birth rate might indicate),
					but the average number of children of an imaginary woman who lives till the end of her entire
					childbearing years (age 15 - 49) is expected to have, in line with the age-specific fertility rate
					of the given year
					(Source: <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN" target="_blank">World
						Bank</a>). This has little bearing on the given country's population size in the given year,
					although it provides informaton about the population's expected growth rate.

				<h4> </h4>
				<h3>Inappropriate data binning and legend</h3>
				<p>The dataset for fertility rate is expressed as &quot;number of kids per female&quot;, which is on a
					continuous, ratio scale. However, the creator chose a discrete 6-colour scale to describe the
					fertility rate of a given country, expressed in [>1, >1.5, >2, >3, >4, >5] kids per female.</p>

				<p>This is confusing for the reader as the categories are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Not mutually exclusive</strong> - there is no upper cap per category according to the
							discrete colour
							scale used. After scrutinising the visualisation, it is likely that the creator meant that a
							country labelled with a fertility rate &quot;more than 1.5 children per female&quot; actually
							has a fertility rate of &quot;more than 1.5, but less than 2 children&quot; per female.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Not exhaustive</strong> - What colour would a country with a fertility rate of &quot;1.0 or
							less&quot;
							children per female would be encoded in? Based on the colour legend, such countries should
							not be on the chart. South Korea's fertility rate was one of the world's lowest at 0.78 in 2022. However, South Korea's
							polygon is coloured purple in the visualisation, although purple is supposed to symobolise
							&quot;more than 1 kids per female&quot;. There is either an error with the labelling, or the data was inaccurate.</p>

				<h4>Idiom (How they are showing it)</h4>
				<h3>Redundant channels</h3>
				<p>The visualisation has multiple channels, and yet only encodes 2 data scales:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Total population size per country (treated as ratio data), encoded as an area magnitude
							channel (2D size of polygons)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Fertility rate per country (treated as nominal data), encoded as discrete colour scale</p>
					</li>
				</ul>


				<p>According to Tamara Munzner, a visualisation is considered to be <strong>"expressive"</strong> only if the
					visualisation's encodings express all of, and only, relevant information of the dataset. There are a
					few redundant channels that are meaningless:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Grouping of countries</strong> - The grouping of the polygons does not appear to follow any
							logical grouping. For example, the European Union countries are all grouped into a single
							polygon as if it is a single country (bottom of the circle), yet countries from the European
							continent or other international political or economic unions are not grouped.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Position of shapes</strong> - The creator tried to fit all countries into the shape
							of a globe. However, the positions of the countries on the visualisation do not appear to be
							aligned with their actual positions on a world globe. For example, the United States appears
							directly below India.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Patterns on shapes</strong> - Some polygons have scale patterns on them (for example,
							India , China, European Union), while others do not. There is no explanation to understand
							how the countries with scale patterns are related to each other.</p>

				<h3>Comparability is difficult</h3>
				<p> It is <strong>hard to compare</strong> the size of similarly sized polygons as there is no consistent shape. There is
					a wide range of shapes - some polygons have 4 sizes (e.g., United States) while others have 13
					(e.g., Brazil). One has to rely on the figures to tell the difference.</p>

				<h4>Suggestions to improve</h4>
				<h3>Encoding of fertility rate data</h3>
				<p><strong>1. Bin the fertility rate into more useful, mutually exclusive and exhaustive
						categories:</strong> <br>
					If we accept that the replacement fertility rate needed to maintain a country's
					population size is 2.1 children per female, 
					and any country with a fertility rate below this is expected to enter population decline over time, 
					the creator could consider using a 3-point discrete colour scale (3 distinctly contrasting colours): </p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Population growing: >=2.1 children per female</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Stable population: 2.1 children per female</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Population in decline: 2.1 children per female</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p><strong>2. Use a continous colour scale for fertility rate:</strong> <br>
					Instead of a discrete colour scale, the creator could use a continuous colour scale to express
					ascending fertility rates across countries e.g., in terms of ascending colour saturation.
				</p>
				<p><strong>3. Consider a different visualisation to present population change rates across countries</strong> <br>
					The creator could have subtracted the crude death rate from the crude birth rate to obtain the population change rate in the absence of migrations, to express which countries are in danger of population decline. 
					As the obtained population change rate would be a continuous data type, the creator could consider a <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/choropleth.html" target="_blank">choropleth map</a> to show population change rate per country in terms of colour saturation.

				<h4></h4>
				<h3>Remove redundant channels</h3>
				<p>The creator can consider removing the redundant channels from the current visualisation, in accordance with the expressiveness principle as earlier mentioned.</p>
				
				<p>The visualisation should only have a <strong>single channel</strong> encoding each dataset:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Total population size per country (treated as continuous data), encoded via a single channel such as area magnitude or position. If a globe shape is still desired by the creator, 
							perhaps the creator could try to keep the shape of each polygon representing each country within the globe consistent (e.g., circle), while using purely an area magnitude channel to encode population data. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Fertility rate per country, which the author can encode as a discrete or continuous colour scale (see "Encoding of fertility rate data" on left). For example, higher fertility rate can be expressed as higher colour saturation.</p>
					</li></ul>
					<p>There should be no patterns on some polygons, unless the patterns are encoding another dataset and represent a relationship between polygons with patterns.</p>
